# AMP KiwiSaver helper
A tool to calculate how much you will need to pay to make the most of government contributions based on reports generated by AMP.

## Instructions

Generate a report on the AMP website for the date range 1 July (either last year or this year, whichever was closest in the past) until today.

Open the report PDF, Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C, then open a text file called `input.txt` and Ctrl+V into that.

When you run the program, it will export all contributions that count towards your $1,042.86 to a CSV called `output.csv`, and print how much more you need to give.

Which contributions count depend on what is in `accounts.txt`. Currently there is the type of contributions _I_ made that count, but if you made others, you will have to add them (note: only add the last two words of the "Account" column, in the "Investment transaction details" section).
