# AMP KiwiSaver helper
A tool to calculate how much you will need to pay to make the most of government contributions based on reports
generated by AMP.

## Premise
The New Zealand Government will pay 50 cents for every dollar that you contribute to your KiwiSaver, up to $521.43 per
year. So to take full advantage of this, you want to contribute at least $1,042.86 each year. This is calculated over
the period 1 Julyâ€“31 June.
See https://www.kiwisaver.govt.nz/new/benefits/mtc/ for more details.

If your KiwiSaver is with AMP, they can generate a report which includes your contributions for an arbitrary date range,
but only as a PDF, and they don't give you a total for the contributions that count towards the $1,042.86.

The only way to get that information is to email them and ask for it, but that gets tiresome
(although it is a good way to double-check).

I created this Python GUI tool that does this for you, based on the text in the PDF.

## Instructions

1. Generate a report on the AMP website for the date range 1 July
(either last year or this year, whichever was closest, but still in the past) until today.

2. Run this app (`./process-report.py`).

2. Open the report PDF, select all (Ctrl+A), then copy it and paste it into this app.

3. That's it! You will now see how much you still need to contribute, and you can export the contributions that count
to a CSV.

## Notes

Which contributions count depend on what is in `accounts.txt`. Currently there is just the type of contributions I
made that count, but if you made others, you will have to add them (note: only add the last two words of the "Account"
column from the PDF, in the "Investment transaction details" section).
